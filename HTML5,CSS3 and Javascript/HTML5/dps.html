		<h2>Spider-Man</h2>
		<p>While not a movie tie-in, Spider-Man stands alone as a great story for the hero, even if it’s not Into the Spider-Verse or Homecoming, and a fantastically fun game that is Insomniac at its best. It has never felt this good to be a superhero, perhaps short of Rocksteady’s Arkham games, and this is a game that is just an absolute blast to play for every single moment you have a controller in hand.</p>
		<h2>God of War</h2>
		<p>Far and away, if you ask most people what the best PS4 exclusive has been of this past generation, most will tell you that it’s God of War. Technically God of War 4, the game is a complete reimagining of the series in a way that could have gone poorly but instead elevated it to new heights. The storytelling, the visuals, the combat—it is truly unmatched in the medium, and you could make the case it might be the best game of this generation.</p>
		<h2>Horizon Zero Dawn</h2>
		<p>Horizon always looked visually gorgeous in previews, but futuristic tribal people hunting robot dinosaurs seemed like an idea that could have gone very wrong. But in the end, Horizon manages to be incredibly fun while actually telling an enormously interesting science fiction story in the process. It also created one of the best new video games icons of the generation in the form of Aloy, which is a rarity in this day and age.</p>
